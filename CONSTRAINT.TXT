Constraints
Constraints provide details about the usage of a column and are applied after specifying the column's data type.
They enable the database to reject any inserted data that violates a particular constraint.
The following statement is used to impose constraints on the "employee" table.

Below is the query to create a table student with a set of constraints.

     CREATE TABLE  student(
     student_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
     student_Name TEXT UNIQUE,
     Department TEXT NOT NULL); 
PRIMARY KEY can be utilized to uniquely identify a row in a table.
When attempting to insert a row with the same value as an existing row in the table, a constraint violation will occur, preventing the insertion of the new row.
UNIQUE columns contain distinct values for each row, similar to "PRIMARY KEY" columns, but unlike primary key columns, a table can have multiple unique columns..
NOT NULL columns must have a value assigned to them.
When attempting to insert a row without providing a value for a "NOT NULL" column, a constraint violation will occur, preventing the insertion of the new row.
QUE 1. Task

employee_id - INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
employee_Name - TEXT UNIQUE,
Department - TEXT NOT NULL


SOL:
