Having
In the previous problem we saw how to use GROUP BY statement.
SQL also gives you an option to filter out which groups should be added and which are to be removed.
For this purpose we use Having statement.
Let us try to find to out the average Age across Division which has more than 50 students.

Below is the query to find out the average Age across Division which has more than 50 students from the table student.

SELECT Division,
AVG(Age),
COUNT(*)
FROM student
GROUP BY Division
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50;
Task
Write a query to find out the average of column 'Payout' across 'Department' which has more than 3 employees from the table 'employee'.
The output table should have the name of the department and their respective average pay.
Rename the column header for the 2nd column as 'avg_payout'.
Code it out in the IDE.

Expected output
┌────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Department │ avg_payout  │
├────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Operations │ 11.227      │
│ Sales      │ 20.34625    │
└────────────┴─────────────┘



SELECT Department, 
AVG(Payout) as 'avg_payout'
FROM employee
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;



────────────┬────────────┐
│ Department │ avg_payout │
├────────────┼────────────┤
│ Operations │ 11.227     │
│ Sales      │ 20.34625   │
└────────────┴────────────┘
