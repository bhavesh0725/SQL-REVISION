Group By
The GROUP BY statement in SQL is used to combine rows with identical values into summary rows.

This statement is frequently paired with aggregate functions such as COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), and AVG() to group the output based on one or more columns.
We saw in the previous problems that clauses like COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG are aggregate functions which take a table and output a single row.
GROUP BY will be used to find the average Payout of each Department.
For example, we've used the AVG() function to find the average payout of the entire table employee.
Now, what if we want to know the Average payout of each department?
In such cases we use Group BY statement.
Below is the query to find the average Age of the students across Divisions in the table student.

SELECT Divisions,AVG(Age)
FROM student
GROUP BY Divisions;
Task
Write a query to find the Average of the column 'Payout' across 'Department' from the table 'employee'.
The output table should have the average payout of each department.
Rename the column header as 'avg_payout' Code it out in the IDE.

Expected Output:
┌────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Department │ avg_payout  │
├────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Hr         │ 21.957      │
│ Operations │ 12.41975    │
│ Product    │ 10.264      │
│ Sales      │ 20.609      │
└────────────┴─────────────┘

sol:
/* Solution as follows */

SELECT Department,
AVG(Payout) as 'avg_payout'
FROM employee
GROUP BY Department;

output:
┌────────────┬────────────┐
│ Department │ avg_payout │
├────────────┼────────────┤
│ Hr         │ 21.957     │
│ Operations │ 12.41975   │
│ Product    │ 10.264     │
│ Sales      │ 20.609     │
└────────────┴────────────┘
