DISTINCT
In the Flights table, what all 'Origins' exist? The following query should give us the result.

     Select Origin 
     from Flights;
However, if we want to find the unique origin locations, we will use the DISTINCT syntax in the following format.

     Select Distinct Origin 
     from Flights;
Write the above query in the IDE to get the unique origin locations.
Code it out in the IDE.

sol:
/* Write a query to find the unique origin locations */
select distinct origin from flights;

output:
┌──────────┐
│  Origin  │
├──────────┤
│ Mumbai   │
│ London   │
│ Ohio     │
│ New York │
│ Beijing  │
│ Damascus │
└──────────┘
