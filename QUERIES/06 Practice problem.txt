Practice problem
Let us combine what we have learnt from our 'SELECT', 'DISTINCT' and 'WHERE' queries.

From the 'Flights' table - let us find the following

Where the origin of the flight is 'New York'
Output the passenger_name and gender
Expected Output
┌────────────────┬────────┐
│ Passenger_name │ Gender │
├────────────────┼────────┤
│ Dia            │ Female │
│ Jackson        │ Male   │
└────────────────┴────────┘
Remember that the column details are as follows

Passenger_id
Passenger_name
Gender
Origin
Destination

sol:
/* Write a query that does the following
- Where the origin of the flight is 'New York'
- Output the passenger_name and gender */

select passenger_name, gender from flights Where origin ='New York';


output:

┌────────────────┬────────┐
│ Passenger_name │ Gender │
├────────────────┼────────┤
│ Dia            │ Female │
│ Jackson        │ Male   │
└────────────────┴────────┘





Debug this query
Let us combine what we have learnt from our 'SELECT', 'DISTINCT' and 'WHERE' queries.

The Query written in the console is trying to do the following.

Where the origin of the flight is 'Mumbai'
Output the 'Distinct' names of 'Male' passengers
Debug this query to get the correct output!

Remember that the column details are as follows

Passenger_id
Passenger_name
Gender
Origin
Destination

sol:
/* Debug this query to get the correct output */

select distinct passenger_name
from flights
where gender = 'Male'and origin = 'Mumbai';

/*
The error in your SQL query is related to the use of a comma (,) instead of the logical operator AND to combine the
conditions in the WHERE clause. The correct syntax for combining multiple conditions is to use AND or OR between them.*/



output:

┌────────────────┐
│ Passenger_name │
├────────────────┤
│ Jackson        │
│ Anthony        │
└────────────────┘
